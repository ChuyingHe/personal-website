Sea far away from the shore -> Shore/beach

- Marine Life: The sea is teeming with marine life. You may see fish swimming near the surface, dolphins leaping out of the water, or even the occasional whale breaching.
- Boats and Ships
- Reflections
- Waves and current
- Navigation Aids: Aerial shots may reveal navigational aids such as buoys, lighthouses, and beacons that assist ships in safe navigation.

## Deployment
Link: [Deploy React App on Remote Server](https://medium.com/@shoolimxonovd/building-and-running-a-react-app-on-a-remote-server-2bff56c305b)
1. Use `npm run build` to build the app, a directive `/build` will be generated by this command
2. Upload the `/build` directive to your remote server using FTP, SCP, or a version control system like Git.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
